# Sentient  

A simulation of the evolving personality inside an AI.   


### Life Begin
The life of an artificial life began, moving at a steady pace.

### Personality Offset
Throughout its lifetime, the agent's mind evolves to confront different events in life, and metabolise them into familiar routines. The two buttons help offset the agent's personality:
 * The **green button** indicates a positive stimulus. Once pressed, the agent feels the happiness, becomes confident; over time, **it moves faster**. The stimulus is memorised by the agent's cognition.  

 * ![02](https://github.com/msc-creative-computing/p-comp-week-1-labs-jasper-zheng/blob/main/src/02-min.gif?raw=true)  

 * Similarly, the **red button** indicates a negative stimulus. Once pressed, the agent feels upset and has to deal with it; therefore, **it moves slower**. Again, the stimulus is memorised by the agent's cognition.  
 * ![03](https://github.com/msc-creative-computing/p-comp-week-1-labs-jasper-zheng/blob/main/src/03-min.gif?raw=true)  

During this simplistic mechanism, the agent's cognition grows. However...

### Eternal Characteristic  

However, an interesting circumstance happens:   

As life goes on, as events happen, you would find that it becomes harder and harder to speed up or slow down the agent. Simply pressing the button once or twice doesn't evidently affect the agent's personality. Eventually, **the pace of the agent becomes stable**, emotion accrues, beliefs are constructed, an eternal characteristic is formed.

This is the achievement of a life lived sentiently.
