## Week_01: An Imagined Future Interface Using only Buttons and LEDs  
#### Sentient
A simulation of the evolving personality inside an AI.

## Week_03: A Feedback System that Eventually Find its Equilibrium
#### Sentient (Reimagined)  
An evolving LED sequence with photoresistor that feedback on itself, constantly updating the moving speed and gradually reach an equilibrium. This is an extension to the week 1 creative lab: Sentient.

## Week_08: Analog Synth!!  
#### Analog Synth with a Lowpass Filter and LFO
I made an analog synthesiser with three knobs:
 * The first one control the pitch of the oscillator.
 * The second one fine tune the pitch of the oscillator in a smaller range.
 * The third one controls the **LFO rate** of an **lowpass filter**.
