Sentient is a simulation of the evolving personality inside an artificial agent.   

## The Life of an Artificial Life

#### Life Begin
The life of an artificial life began, moving at a steady pace.

#### Personality Offset
Throughout its lifetime, the agent's mind evolves to confront the events in life, and metabolise them into familiar routines. The two buttons help offset the agent's personality:
 * The green button indicates a positive stimulus. Once pressed, the agent feels the happiness, becomes confident; over time, it moves faster. The stimulus is memorised by the agent's cognition.

 * Similarly, the red button indicates a negative stimulus. Once pressed, the agent feels upset and has to deal with it; therefore, it moves slower. Again, the stimulus is memorised by the agent's cognition.

During this simplistic mechanism, the agent's cognition grows.
