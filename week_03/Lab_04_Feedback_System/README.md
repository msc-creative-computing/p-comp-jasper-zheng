# Sentient (Reimagined)  

An evolving LED sequence with photoresistor that feedback on itself, constantly updating the moving speed and gradually reach an equilibrium. This is an extension to the [week 1 creative lab: Sentient](https://github.com/msc-creative-computing/p-comp-jasper-zheng/tree/main/week_01/Pt.%202%20Creative_Labs).

The pace of the agent is constantly changing. The update rules are fairly simple:  
 * If the agent is moving too fast, negative stimuli will be triggered, therefore slow down its pace. An **"upset memory"** is formed.
 * If the agent is moving too slow, positive stimuli will be triggered, therefore speed up its pace. A **"vibrant memory"** is formed.

In the end, the agent experiences more, its cognition is reinforced, and it eventually reaches an equilibrium. Therefore, **the pace of the agent becomes stable**, an eternal characteristic is formed.
