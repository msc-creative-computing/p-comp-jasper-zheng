### Life Begin
The life of an artificial creature begin, moving at a steady and vibrant pace.

### Personality Offset
Throughout its lifetime, the agent's mind evolves to confront different events in life, and metabolise them into familiar routines. The two buttons act as a training machine, help offset the agent's personality:
 * The **green button** indicates a positive stimulus. Once pressed, the agent feels the happiness, becomes confident and vibrant; over time, **it moves faster**. The stimulus is memorised by the agent's cognition.  

 * ![02](https://github.com/msc-creative-computing/p-comp-jasper-zheng/blob/main/week_01/src/02-min.gif?raw=true)  

 * Similarly, the **red button** indicates a negative stimulus. Once pressed, the agent feels upset and has to deal with it; therefore, **it moves slower**. Again, the stimulus is memorised by the agent's cognition.

By this simplistic mechanism, the agent's cognition grows, characteristic is gradually constructed.

### Eternal Characteristic  
At the beginning, the agent is sensitive to new events. Its cognition is incapable to deal with the ever-changing environment. Therefore, a small stimulus may dramatically affect its pace.  

However, as buttons are pressed, it becomes harder and harder to speed up or slow down the agent. At that moment, simply pressing the button once or twice doesn't evidently affect the agent's pace anymore.  

As life goes on, as the agent experiences more, its cognition is reinforced, and it eventually reaches an equilibrium. Therefore, **the pace of the agent becomes stable**, emotion accrues, personality are constructed, an eternal characteristic is formed.

This is the achievement of a life lived sentiently.
